Create CDRs from Vodafone PDF Bill
----------------------------------

1.	Extract unprocessed text CDR data from a PDF bill
		bin/pdf2txt "data/Sitec Vodafone May Bill.pdf" tmp/raw-pdf.txt

2.	Generate CDRs from unprocessed text CDR data
		node bin/txt2cdr.js -cdr="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/tmp/cdr-pdf.json" -txt="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/tmp/raw-pdf.txt"

3.	Print a replica Vodafone bill
		node bin/vodabill.js -cdr="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/tmp/cdr-pdf.json" -year=2016 -month=May -org=Sitec

4.	Generate an MVNO bill from a CDR file
		node bin/billing.js -cdr="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/tmp/cdr-pdf.json" -out=table



Create CDRs from Vodafone CSV File
----------------------------------

1.	Generate CDRs from records in CSV file
		node bin/csv2cdr.js -csv="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/data/Phone Itemisation.csv" -cdr="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/tmp/cdr-csv.json"

2.	Generate an MVNO bill from a CDR file
		node bin/billing.js -cdr="/home/bf/Temp/mvno/tmp/cdr-csv.json" -out=table





OUTSTANDING ISSUES
------------------
txt2cdr.js
	Missing some records with unwanted stuff in column 1 but CDRs in column 2

vodabill.js
	Add total h:m:s of calls for handset + qty of texts
	Running total for all numbers called (handset and company) and whether in VPN
	Show summary table for each handset of calls/texts to all numbers
	Show summary table for company of calls/texts to all numbers
x	Some reports dont have calls so report heading is missing
	Data issues
		Does not cater for prorating of call/data sitting on threshold (25/5 17:55 8m8s Full=0.900 Prorated=0.225)
x		Does VPN mean other phones in Sitec (build a list as processing happens and show as subtotal)
	Analysis
		Work out % of usage and other charges vs total
	Graphs
		Call heat map for phone (http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084)
			X day, Y  number, intersection is heat white->red based on most calls/day
