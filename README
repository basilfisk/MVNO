OUTSTANDING ISSUES
------------------
txt2cdr.js
	Missing some records with unwanted stuff in column 1 but CDRs in column 2
	Sort out column widths
	p53 284594 Total is close, but split is wrong

vodabill.js
	Issues
		index_page should show a list of all months
	Extra report tables
		Summary of handsets in VPN
		Summary for company of calls/texts to all numbers
	Data issues
		Does not cater for prorating of call/data sitting on threshold (25/5 17:55 8m8s Full=0.900 Prorated=0.225)
		Does VPN mean other phones in Sitec (build a list as processing happens and show as subtotal)
	Analysis
		Work out % of usage and other charges vs total
	Graphs
		2d data X:days, Y:handsets
		2d messages (text,long,vid,pic) X:days, Y:handsets
		Call heat map for phone (http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084)
			X day, Y  number, intersection is heat white->red based on most calls/day
	Database
		Move vodafone.json -> provider collection
		Move sitec.json -> customer collection
		Move rates.json -> mvno collection
		read_company should use Mongo instead fo FS
